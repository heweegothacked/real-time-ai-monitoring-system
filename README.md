## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\nflpr\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Project1
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 How to Use

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step-by-Step Usage

1. **Initialize the System**
   - Click "🔄 Initialize System" in the left sidebar
   - This generates 50 historical readings and trains the AI model

2. **Explore the Dashboard**
   - **Live Data Tab**: View current sensor readings and time series graphs
   - **AI Predictions Tab**: See what the model predicts for the next 5 hours
   - **Anomaly Detection Tab**: Identify unusual readings
   - **Analysis Tab**: View trends and statistical distributions

3. **Add New Readings**
   - Click "➕ Add New Reading" to simulate new sensor data
   - Watch predictions update in real-time

4. **Adjust Settings**
   - Change anomaly probability to see different sensor behaviors
   - Adjust prediction steps (1-20) to predict further into the future
   - Modify contamination rate to change anomaly detection sensitivity

## 🧠 Understanding the AI Models

### 1. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)

The system uses **Isolation Forest**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that:
- Learns the "normal" patterns in sensor data
- Identifies readings that deviate significantly from normal patterns
- Works well without requiring labeled anomalies in training data

**How it works:**
- Isolates unusual data points through random partitioning
- Assigns anomaly scores based on how "isolated" a point is
- Flags high-scoring points as anomalies

### 2. Trend Prediction (Linear Regression)

The system uses **Linear Regression** to:
- Analyze historical trends in each metric
- Predict future values based on past patterns
- Generate predictions 5-20 steps ahead

**Breakdown:**
- Fits a line to historical data
- Uses the line's equation to predict future values
- Clips predictions to realistic ranges (e.g., -10°C to 50°C for temperature)

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Adding a New Sensor Type

Edit `src/sensor_simulator.py`:

```python
def __init__(self, random_seed=42):
    # ... existing code ...
    self.new_metric = 0.0  # Add your metric
```

### Changing Prediction Algorithm

Edit `src/ml_model.py` to replace `LinearRegression` with other models:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
# Replace LinearRegression with RandomForestRegressor
```

### Modifying Dashboard Layout

Edit `src/dashboard.py` to change:
- Colors and styling (CSS section)
- Number of tabs and visualizations
- Metrics displayed on the main page

## 📊 Example Output

When you run the dashboard, you'll see:

1. **Current Metrics**: Real-time temperature, humidity, pressure readings
2. **Time Series Graphs**: Visual representation of all readings over time
3. **Prediction Charts**: Forecasted values for the next 5 hours
4. **Anomaly Timeline**: Highlighted unusual readings
5. **Statistical Summary**: Mean, standard deviation, and distribution analysis


## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found" error
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the project directory and have activated the virtual environment.

### Issue: Dashboard shows no data
**Solution**: Click "Initialize System" in the sidebar first.

### Issue: Streamlit connection error
**Solution**: Make sure port 8501 isn't in use. Try: `streamlit run src/dashboard.py --server.port 8502`

## 📈 Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add real sensor integration (temperature sensors, IoT devices)
- Implement multiple anomaly detection algorithms and compare
- Add alert notifications for detected anomalies
- Store historical data in a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku, Railway)
- Add more sophisticated models (LSTM, Random Forest)
- Implement data export functionality (CSV, JSON)

## 📝 Notes for Beginners

- **What is anomaly detection?** Finding unusual patterns that don't match the normal behavior
- **What is prediction?** Using past data to make educated guesses about the future
- **Why machine learning?** Allows the system to learn patterns automatically without hard-coded rules
- **Why Streamlit?** Fast way to build interactive web apps with Python (no web development experience needed)
